### Requirements

[✅] Create a browser-based card matching game that presents the player with cards arranged in a 4x4 grid.
[✅] Ensure card back has a common design  and card front contains a distinctive symbol shared by one pair of cards.
[✅] Selecting two cards with different symbols will result in both flipped back over, obscuring their  symbols.
[✅] Selecting two cards whose symbols match, along with those successfully matched in previous turns, will remain flipped up.
[✅] Include a 'New Game' button to reset the game board.

### Built With
